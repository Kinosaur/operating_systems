# Page Replacement Algorithms Simulation

A Java-based simulation of Operating System **Virtual Memory Page Replacement Algorithms**.  
This program demonstrates **Demand Paging** by visualizing how logical pages are loaded into physical memory frames and how **page faults** occur under different replacement policies.

---

## 📖 Overview

Virtual Memory allows processes to execute even if they are not completely loaded into physical memory.  
When a program references a page that is not currently in memory, a **page fault** occurs, and the Operating System must decide which existing page should be replaced.

This simulator studies and compares the behavior of three classic page replacement algorithms:

1.  **Optimal Page Replacement** (Implemented)  
    Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future. This algorithm provides the theoretical minimum number of page faults but is difficult to implement in real systems requiring future knowledge.

2.  **LRU (Least Recently Used)** (Implemented)  
    Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time in the past. This is a popular approximation of the Optimal algorithm.

3.  **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** (Implemented)  
    Replaces the page that has been in memory the longest, treating memory like a circular buffer.

## 🚀 Features

* **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Displays the state of each memory frame after every page reference using the format `index[ page ]`.
* **Page Fault Tracking**: Clearly identifies page faults and shows exactly which "victim" page is replaced.
* **Robust Input Validation**:
    * Page reference string (Max 20 characters).
    * Memory frame size (Max 10 frames).
* **Interactive Menu**: Allows users to run multiple simulations back-to-back using the same or different reference strings.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Main.java`** | The entry point. Handles user inputs, validation, and the simulation menu loop. |
| **`SimulationEngine.java`** | The "Conductor." Manages the demand paging loop, detects page faults, and delegates the victim selection to the chosen algorithm strategy. |
| **`MemoryFrame.java`** | Represents Physical Memory. It is a "dumb" container that holds pages and displays its state. |
| **`ReplacementAlgorithm.java`** | An Interface defining the contract for all algorithms (`findVictim`). |
| **`OptimalAlgorithm.java`** | Implements the **Optimal** strategy by "looking ahead" into the future reference string. |
| **`LRUAlgorithm.java`** | Implements the **LRU** strategy by "looking backward" to find the least recently used page. |
| **`FIFOAlgorithm.java`** | Implements the **FIFO** strategy using a circular pointer to track the oldest page. |

## 🖥️ Usage Example

### 1. Input Phase

```text
PAGE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHMS SIMULATION
========================================
Enter a Page Reference string without space <Max 20>: 232152453252
Enter the size of Memory Frame <Max 10>: 3

```

### 2. Selection Phase

```text
Algorithm Option Menu:
====================
1. OPTIMAL
2. LRU
3. FIFO
4. Exit simulation

Select an OPTION from above by entering its number: 2

```

### 3. Simulation Output (LRU Example)

```text
LRU PAGE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHM
=====================================

Reference string: 2
0[ 2 ]
1[   ]
2[   ]
...
Reference string: 5
=> Page Fault!
Replace 3 with 5
0[ 2 ]
1[ 5 ]
2[ 1 ]

Total 4 Page Fault(s) generated by LRU ALGORITHM!

```

## 🧠 Theory Background

* **Demand Paging**: Pages are loaded into memory only when they are referenced during execution.
* **Victim Frame**: The memory frame selected by the replacement algorithm to be evicted when a page fault occurs and memory is full.
* **Thrashing**: A state where the system spends more time paging (swapping) than executing caused by having too few frames.
